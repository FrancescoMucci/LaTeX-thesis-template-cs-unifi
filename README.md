# LaTeX thesis template for Computer Science at UniFI

This repository contains a LaTeX template for a (bachelor's or master's) thesis in Computer Science carried out at the [University of Florence](https://www.unifi.it/).

I developed this template for my master's thesis starting from the one provided by [my degree course](https://www.informaticamagistrale.unifi.it/vp-17-per-laurearsi.html) which in turn was developed using the [`classicthesis`](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/classicthesis) package, created by [*Andr√© Miede*](https://www.miede.de/), as a basis.
